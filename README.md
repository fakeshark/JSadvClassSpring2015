Course description

This course builds on the student’s understanding of Javascript learned in 
previous courses. Javascript is the programming language used to extend the 
capabilities of the web browser to include animation, interactive forms, object 
control, and basic decision-making. Topics addressed will include client-side 
form validation, Object Oriented Programming, DOM Manipulation, data IO, 
persistance and the HTML 5 canvas.


 

Important prior courses: SE 111 (XHTML/Javascript), SE 266 (Web Development 
Using PHP and MySQL)

Having taken the courses listed above, students are expected already to be able to:

Createweb pages in a text editor that utilize HTML and CSS
Create simple applications with flow control, variables, and functions
Understand data storage and organization
Understand the use of server-side scripting

 

Course objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to use 
JavaScript to:

Create solutions to programming problems as evidenced by the creation of small 
web applications.
Evaluate information obtained from independent research and in-class lecture to 
determine the actual solutions to programming problems.
Analyse information obtained from independent research and in-class lecture to 
find potential solutions for programming problems.
Analyse code written in lab assignments to adequately document one’s work.
Apply knowledge obtained from previous quarters, in-class lectures and out of 
class research to the creation of small web applications and the completion of 
online tutorials.
Understand and describe the use of Javascript code as evidenced by the 
commenting of javascript written during in class labs.
Remember concepts from software engineering courses as evidenced by the 
completion of online tutorials and in class lab assignments.
Collaborate on the development of a small video game that utilizes the HTML5 
Canvas Element.

Assignment Objectives:
 
Each assignment will correspond with one of the following objectives.
Program applications that run in a web browser
Draw and animate elements on the HTML5 Canvas
Manipulate elements in the document object model
Handle browser events such as clicks, form interactions and load events
Validate data using regular expressions
Store data client-side
Interface with server-side applications
Understand Objects and their use
Independently research programming solutions

Required textbook:
None. Students are recommend to use books 24/7 which is a serviced offered to 
all students.
https://library.neit.edu/Search-Articles/Search-Articles (Links to an external 
site.)

Recommended supplies:
A flash drive, notebook computer, or web service on which you can back up your 
work frequently.  A portable hard drive would be a better choice and is highly 
recommended.

An account with jsfiddle.net (http://www.jsfiddle.net (Links to an external site.))

An account with codeacademy.com (http://www.codeacademy.com (Links to an external site.))

A github.com account.  Please use the first letter of your first name and your 
last name for the account if possible. Gabriel Forti would be gforti.  All 
assignments must be posted on your github.com account before you submit the url 
to your account.

 

EVALUATION CRITERIA/GRADING:

Lab and long-term Assignments ........70%
Mid-term/Final exam...........................20%
Forum Participation.............................5%
Attendance..........................................5%
  

Assessment Measures:
Students will demonstrate their knowledge predominantly by completing lab 
assignments as well as lessons on codeacademy.com and the clear documenting of 
code written during labs. Assignment evaluation criteria will include correct 
and complete functionality of the code, use of techniques and methods discussed 
in class, and other instructor-determined criteria.

Attendance and Tardiness:
Your on-time arrival is appreciated and expected.
Lectures are started at the beginning of class.

Late work and make-ups:
Each assignment turned after its due date will have its grade reduced by 5% per 
day. Accommodation for unusual life events may be made if you contact me via 
email at least one day before the assignment is due.

Final deadline: No work or exam can be turned in after the conclusion of the 
final class period.

Where NEIT policy indicates otherwise, NEIT policies will of course be followed.

Lab time is critical
Since labs are assigned at the beginning of class and due at the end of class, 
much of the learning that will occur throughout this course will happen during 
lab time.

Please do not leave lab unless you have completed the current assignment and 
verified that the zip file is correctly submitted to Canvas.

 

The student is expected to:
Attend all scheduled lectures and labs, arriving on time.

Check Canvas (neit.instructure.com) on a regular basis for class announcements, 
additional notes, and assignments.

Keep abreast of what is covered in class if an absence occurs, including 
material delivered verbally in class that may not be included in printed documents.

Be respectful to other students and the instructor in the classroom. This 
includes not talking while lecture or instructions are being given as well as 
refraining from using offensive language.

Work together to find solutions. Although I will not accept code that has been 
copied directly from another student, I encourage students to work together 
during lab time. Programming is often best accomplished in collaboration.

Preliminary course outline:

This schedule is a work-in-progress and is subject to change on account of 
student needs, weather, etc. Visit Canvas frequently for announcements and 
updates. Labassignment requirements will be detailed in separate documents.

Please at least skim through Canvas Course Documents and Announcements for each 
week before class. Doing so will help it make sense in the limited time we have 
to talk about the topics before getting down to work.

Policies:
My job is to provide equal, ample opportunity to learn. To that end I require 
electrical and electronic devices such as pagers and phones to be in either the 
“off” or “silent” mode. Ringing phones in a class setting are simply rude. If your 
phone vibrates, please quietly exit the room before answering it.

Any use of communication or information retrieval devices and services during 
exams and quizzes except as specifically instructed will be considered a breach 
of the Academic Honesty Policy (see below).

 Finally, I’d appreciate it if you refrained from surfing the web, checking 
email, playing games or monitoring sports events during class time. While I 
might not notice, these activities are extremely distracting to some of your 
fellow students and I have a right to expect that you won’t engage in rude 
behavior that adversely affects our class experiences. If I am failing to make 
the class sufficiently interesting and challenging, please let me know.

 Student Handbook:http://wcb.neit.edu/shandbook/SyllabusPolicies.pdf

 Each student is responsible for accessing this web site and becoming familiar 
with the following policies:

 

ACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY

Any project, paper, or examination is expected to be the student's own work, in 
the student's own words. Academic dishonesty (including but not limited to 
copying another student's work or allowing one's own work to be copied; using 
notes or books during an examination without the instructor's advance permission; 
presenting information or images copied from a book, journal, or online source 
as one's own) will not be tolerated. (See the web site for the full policy)

  

OTHER POLICIES 

Each student is responsible for accessing the Student Handbook web site 
(http://wcb.neit.edu/shandbook/syllabuspolicies.pdf (Links to an external site.)) 
and becoming familiar with all academic policies.

“The design of this course as outlined in the syllabus requires you to do work 
outside of class to be successful.”
